# Part B — Reliability & Idempotency

## Burst Handling & Backoff

I would choose an **exponential backoff with jitter** strategy when handling temporary throttling errors like HTTP 429 or intermittent timeouts. Specifically, better to start with a small base delay (e.g., 500 ms) and double the wait time on each retry up to a maximum limit (e.g., 30 seconds). Adding random jitter helps to spread retries over time, preventing bursts of simultaneous retries that could overwhelm the system again.

Additionally, I would implement a **token bucket rate limiter** to control the flow of requests proactively. This allows a steady, smooth request rate with limited bursts, reducing the risk of hitting throttling limits in the first place.

I have chosen these approaches based on past experience where fixed-interval retries caused retry storms and system overloads. The jitter and token bucket algorithm have proven effective in smoothing traffic and increasing overall reliability.

## Deduplication and Collision Handling

To ensure deduplication we can generate unique **idempotency keys** or request IDs and save them in a durable store such as DynamoDB. This allows the system to detect and skip duplicate processing attempts.

For longer workflows, I would apply **checkpointing** to save intermediate states. In case of failure, the process can safely resume from the last known good checkpoint, avoiding duplicated or partial results.

My retry mechanisms would always verify state before retrying, ensuring safe recovery without risking collisions or inconsistent partial processing.

# Part C — Scaling

## Resilience Under Parallel Load

I will design the system architecture using a **distributed task queue** like AWS SQS, where each task is processed independently by stateless workers running in AWS Lambda or ECS containers.

To isolate failures and prevent cascading errors, I can use **visibility timeouts** for tasks and configure **dead-letter queues (DLQ)** to capture failed tasks after a certain number of retries.  

To add robustness, good practice to implement **circuit breakers** and **bulkhead patterns** in services to limit the impact of failures on the whole system.

For handling “poison pill” tasks that keep failing, I would monitor retry counts and once max retries are reached, route those tasks to the DLQ. Then alert the team for analysis and quarantine to prevent disruption.

## Cost Efficiency and Simplicity

It`s possible to minimize cloud costs by avoiding always-on or oversized EC2 autoscaling groups which can generate idle costs.

Instead, I’d favor **serverless compute** such as AWS Lambda combined with managed messaging services like SQS, which are pay-per-use and scale automatically.

To control unexpected costs need to set strict CloudWatch alarms and AWS Budgets.

Here is an example SQS RedrivePolicy configuration to limit retries and automatically send failed messages to a DLQ:

{
    "RedrivePolicy": {
        "deadLetterTargetArn": "arn:aws:sqs:region:account:myDLQ",
        "maxReceiveCount": "5"
    }
}

## Scaling Without Overhead

I would leverage AWS metrics such as **SQS ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible** to trigger scaling events for ECS tasks or Lambda concurrency automatically.

To prevent runaway scaling, need to configure AWS Lambda **Reserved Concurrency** limits.

Finally, set CloudWatch alarms on important application metrics—like processing latency and error rates—to trigger scaling and alerting actions dynamically.
